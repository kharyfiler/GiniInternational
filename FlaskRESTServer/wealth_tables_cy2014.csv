"NOTE: In dollars. Estimates are conditional on asset ownership. Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. (B) - Base is less than 200,000 households, or sample size less than 50. Estimates rounded to four signficant digits. 'Other Assets' includes assets from a catch-all question, and includes assets such as coins, jewelry, artwork, mortgages paid to household members, other loans owed to household members, or royalties. Interpolated medians used to calculate statistics. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Please see SIPP User Notes at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/tech-documentation/user-notes /2014-user-notes.html> for information on changes to 'Equity in Business or Profession' and 'Other Assets' in the 2014 data. Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. For information on sampling and nonsampling error see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sampling.html

"NOTE: Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. (D) - Cell suppressed due to a small number of observations.'Other Assets' includes assets from a catch-all question, and includes assets such as coins, jewelry, artwork, mortgages paid to household members, other loans owed to household members, or royalties. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. For information on sampling and nonsampling error see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sampling.html

"NOTE: Table 3 presents ownership rates for the subcomponents of assets at financial institutions and other interest-earning assets. Table 2 presents ownership rates for the overall categories. Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. Number of households have been rounded to four significant digits.  (D) - Cell suppressed due to a small number of observations. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant.

"NOTE: In dollars. Estimates are conditional on asset ownership and net worth below the 99th percentile. Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. (B) - Base is less than 200,000 households, or sample size less than 50. Estimates rounded to four signficant digits. 'Other Assets' includes assets from a catch-all question, and includes assets such as coins, jewelry, artwork, mortgages paid to household members, other loans owed to household members, or royalties. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Please see SIPP User Notes at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/tech-documentation/user-notes /2014-user-notes.html> for information on changes to 'Equity in Business or Profession' and 'Other Assets' in the 2014 data. Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. For information on sampling and nonsampling error see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sampling.html

"NOTE: In dollars. Estimates are conditional on asset ownership. Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. (B) - Base is less than 200,000 households, or sample size less than 50. Standard errors have been calculated using replicate weights. Standard error of 0 indicates that the width of the confidence interval for this estimate rounds to zero. Standard errors have been rounded to four significant digits. 'Other Assets' includes assets from a catch-all question, and includes assets such as coins, jewelry, artwork, mortgages paid to household members, other loans owed to household members, or royalties. Interpolated medians have been used to calculate statistics. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Please see SIPP User Notes at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/tech-documentation/user-notes /2014-user-notes.html> for information on changes to 'Equity in Business or Profession' and 'Other Assets' in the 2014 data. Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. For information on sampling and nonsampling error see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sampling.html

"NOTE: Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. Standard errors have been calculated using replicate weights. (D) - Cell suppressed due to a small number of observations. 'Other Assets' includes assets from a catch-all question, and includes assets such as coins, jewelry, artwork, mortgages paid to household members, other loans owed to household members, or royalties. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. For information on sampling and nonsampling error see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sampling.html

"NOTE: Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. Standard errors have been calculated using replicate weights. Number of households have been rounded to four significant digits. (D) - Cell suppressed due to a small number of observations. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant.

"NOTE: In dollars. Estimates are conditional on asset ownership and net worth below the 99th percentile. Sample excludes group quarters and households in which the household reference person was either living outside the United States in December, living in institutionalized group quarters in December, or was living in a non-permanent accommodation in December. (B) - Base is less than 200,000 households, or sample size less than 50. Standard errors have been calculated using replicate weights. Standard error of 0 indicates that the width of the confidence interval for this estimate rounds to zero. Standard errors have been rounded to four significant digits. 'Other Assets' includes assets from a catch-all question, and includes assets such as coins, jewelry, artwork, mortgages paid to household members, other loans owed to household members, or royalties. A household’s participation in government programs is defined as having received benefits from any of the following programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and General Assistance (GA). Please see SIPP User Notes at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/tech-documentation/user-notes /2014-user-notes.html> for information on changes to 'Equity in Business or Profession' and 'Other Assets'  in the 2014 data. Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. There are two basic ways of defining a race group. A group such as Black may be defined as those who reported Black and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Black regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race-alone). The use of the single race population does not imply it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Because Hispanics may be any race, data in this table for Hispanics overlap slightly with data for the Black population. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives are not shown because of their small sample size. The race or Hispanic origin of the householder designates the race or Hispanic origin of the household. The estimates in this table are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from the actual values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, apparent differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant. For information on sampling and nonsampling error see: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sampling.html
